# TPM802A Model Based Water System Assessment

This repository contains several models and analyses developed as part of the TPM802A Model Based Water System Assessment course.

## The Final Assignment: The Nile River Basin Analysis

### 1. **Code**
The code for the final assignment can be found in the following file: [`TPM802A_River_Basin_Tradeoff_vulnerability_analysis_revised.ipynb`](https://github.com/movephutthaphaiboon/model-based-water-systems-assessment/blob/main/TPM802A_River_Basin_Tradeoff_vulnerability_analysis_revised.ipynb)


### 2. **Scenario Testing Results**

The results of the scenario testing for the Nile River Basin analysis are stored in [`water_basin_scenario_testing_results`](https://github.com/movephutthaphaiboon/model-based-water-systems-assessment/tree/main/water_basin_scenario_testing_results)


These results include the outcomes of simulations under 5000 scenarios, providing insights into the system's behavior under uncertainty.
