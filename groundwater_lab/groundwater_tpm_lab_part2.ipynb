    "Consider a well located in a uniform flow field near a river running North-South, as in the previous example. Near the well is a contaminated area as shown in the figure below (run the code cell). For the current discharge of the well ($Q=200$ m$^3$/d), the well captures water from the contaminated area, as can be seen, e.g., by starting a streampath from the corner of the contaminated area. The discharge of the well must be decreased such that it doesn't capture water from the contaminated area. Determine and print to the screen the maximum discharge of the well such that the well doesn't capture water from the contaminated area."
